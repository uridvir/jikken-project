# jikken-project
My WPI MQP project in Japan, during the B22 Term. The purpose of _Jikken_ is to control a high-speed camera and analyze the resulting footage,
all in one convenient to use tool. This helps to automate the experiment procedure.

This project automates controlling the 1998 Kodak Motion Corder over serial cable. If you want to use my code to do something similar,
look at the src/camera and src/cameramenu folders.
